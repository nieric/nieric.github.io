I am a currently a Ph.D. student at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://chalmers.se/en/) (Aug 2021 - ~Jun 2026) under the supervision of Prof. [Ulf Gran](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/ulfgran/). My research is focused on various aspects of novel electron transport. This includes hydrodynamic and tomographic transport in 2D materials, as well as strange metal phase in high-temperature superconductors. I have modeled electrons in 2D using kinetic theory, and investigated plasmons in strange metals using holography ("AdS/CMT"), where one solves a gravitaional problem in higher dimension.
