I greatly enjoy teaching.

During my studies, I taught mathematics to the students at the Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics programs at Chalmers. For this I was awarded the 'Guldk√§rnan' award *twice* by the students (a yealy award for the best TA). I was especially happy about recieving this in 2021, as it was the year of Covid-19 so all teaching was done remotely. I think this made the relationship with the students a bit more personal (I remember giving the last TA session of 2020 from *Chalmerska huset* - very fancy, with images of old Chalmers presidents behind me). In the academic year of 2019/20 I held an part-time *amanuensis* teaching position at the [Department of Mathematical Sciences](https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/mv/)

Since starting my PhD in 2021, I moved on to teaching physics, where I've had the great pleasure to teach a wonderful set of courses. I have TA:d in Mechanics I and II, taught over 3/4ths of the first year to the Engineering Physics students. Mech II is notoriously difficult (Lagrangians and coupled ODEs to 1st year students) but also very fun, as this is the first taste the students get of "real" physics. The first year students are also very eager to ask questions (perhaps I notice a decline over the year...).

I also got the opportunity to give half of the lectures in the MSc course in String theory, 2022-25. This was quite a challenge but very rewarding - teaching a subject really is the best way to learn it! My lectures covered the first part of Barton Zwiebach's book as well a (very) brief introduction to AdS/CFT and holography. I have also handled most of the course administration (home problems, projects etc.).

In 2024 I also supervised a group of 6 students doing their [BSc thesis](https://odr.chalmers.se/items/a3ac7e79-9ef1-4dca-831f-685157e691cd) (NB: in Swedish), as well as a [MSc thesis](https://odr.chalmers.se/items/54eefafb-7af9-4ebc-87cf-3cae0fe8a0c5) by Eli Ismailov. [Eli](https://www.chalmers.se/personer/ismailov/) started his PhD in our group in 2025.
