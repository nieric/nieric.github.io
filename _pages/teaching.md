I greatly enjoy teaching.

During my studies, I taught mathematics to the students at the Engineering Physics and Engineering Mathematics programs at Chalmers. For this I was awarded the `Guldk√§rnan' award *twice* by the students (a yealy award for the best TA). I was especially happy about recieving this in 2021, as it was the year of Covid-19 so all teaching was done remotely. I think this made the relationship with the students a bit more personal (I remember giving the last TA session of 2020 from *Chalmerska huset* - very fancy, with images of old Chalmers presidents behind me).

Since starting my PhD, I moved on to teaching physics, and I've gotten to teach (in my opinion) the best possible set of courses. I have TA:d in Mechanics I and II, taught over 3/4ths of the first year to the Engineering Physics. Mech II is notoriously difficult (Lagrangians and coupled ODEs to 1st year students) but also very fun, as this is the first taste the students get of "real" physics.

I also got the opportunity to give half of the lectures in the MSc course in String theory. This was quite a challenge but very rewarding - teaching a subject really is the best way to learn it. My lectures covered the first part of Barton Zwiebach's book as well a (very) brief introduction to AdS/CFT and holography. I handled most of the course administration as well (home problems, projects etc.)
