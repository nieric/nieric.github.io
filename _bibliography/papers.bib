  abstract = {Pauli blocking in Fermi liquids imposes strong phase-space constraints on quasiparticle lifetimes,
  leading to a well-known quadratic-in-temperature decay rate of quasiparticle modes at low temperatures. In
  two-dimensional systems, however, even longer-lived modes are predicted (dubbed “odd-parity” modes)
  that involve a collective deformation of the Fermi distribution. Here, we present an efficient method to
  evaluate the full spectrum of relaxational eigenmodes of a Fermi liquid within kinetic theory. We employ
  this method to study the experimentally relevant case of a Fermi liquid with screened Coulomb interactions
  and map out the decay rates of quasiparticle modes beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit up to the
  Fermi temperature, thus covering the entire temperature range of typical experiments. We confirm the
  existence of anomalously long-lived odd-parity modes and provide a comprehensive classification and
  detailed analysis of the relaxation spectrum. In particular, we find that (i) the odd-parity effect in the decay
  rates extends to temperatures as large as $T = 0.15 T_F$, (ii) there is only a small number of long-lived oddparity modes, with an infinite number of remaining modes that show standard Fermi-liquid scaling, and
  (iii) the ratio between the odd- and even-parity lifetimes is tunable with the Coulomb interaction strength, in
  addition to temperature, which reflects a difference in the microscopic relaxation mechanism of the modes.
  Our findings provide a comprehensive description of the nonequilibrium relaxation behavior of twodimensional electron gases and bridge a significant gap in our understanding of these systems.}
