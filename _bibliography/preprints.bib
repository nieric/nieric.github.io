  abstract = {In interaction-dominated two-dimensional electron gases at intermediate temperatures, electron transport is not diffusive as in the conventional Drude picture but instead hydrodynamic. The relevant transport coefficient in this regime is the shear viscosity. Here, we develop a numerically exact basis expansion to solve the Fermi liquid equation, and apply it to compute the shear viscosity of the electron gas with screened Coulomb interactions. Our calculations are valid at all temperatures and in particular describe the response beyond the asymptotic low-temperature limit, where perturbative approaches exist. We show that even in this low-temperature limit, there is a nonanalytic exchange contribution to the shear viscosity, highlighting the need for a full nonperturbative solution of the Fermi liquid equation. We hope that the techniques developed in this work will serve as a platform to determine the response of interacting Fermi liquids.}
