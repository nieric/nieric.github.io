Understanding the anomalous transport properties of strange metals—such as those found in high-temperature superconductors—remains one of the central open problems in condensed matter physics. Holographic duality, originally developed in high-energy physics, can offer insights into these systems. Most of the holographic models have only considered systems subject to an external gauge (electric) field, as is suitable for determinining e.g., the electrical conductivity. However, the density-density correlation function - which governs the plasmon response of the system - requires electromagnetism to be treated dynamically. Recent experiments on the plasmon response in strange metals has shown that is its strongly damped: indeed, in holographic models that properly treats dynamical electromagnetism, a fininte damping even at zero momentum is a robust feature.

I have worked on properly formulating the entire dynamical E&M framework within holography; how to obtain full dielectric function (and the permittivity), which gives access to the D- and H-fields within the materials, and how to consider general geometric setups (e.g., a slab geometry). In particular, we have stuided the surface plasmon polariton response. The paper is in progress, but preliminary results can be found in my MSc {% cite nilsson_surface_2021 %} and Licentiate {% cite nilsson_electron_2024 %} theses.
