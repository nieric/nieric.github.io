Understanding the anomalous transport properties of strange metals—such as those found in high-temperature superconductors—remains one of the central open problems in condensed matter physics. Holographic duality, originally developed in high-energy physics, can offer insights into these systems. By combining holographic models with ideas from effective medium theory (EMT), we investigate how nanoscale spatial inhomogeneity might influence the macroscopically observable transport properties such as the magnetoresistance. By bridging microscopic models of strongly correlated electron systems with mesoscopic disorder, we hope to develop a theoretical framework that captures multiple experimental signatures of the strange metal phase within a unified description.
