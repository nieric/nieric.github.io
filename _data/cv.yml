- title: Academic Interests
  type: nested_list
  contents:
    - title: AdS/CMT
      items:
        - Describing strongly correlated condensed matter systems using holography ("AdS/CFT").
        - Building more realistic holographic models of strange metals, e.g., by correctly including momentum dissipation and the Coulomb interaction.
    - title: 2D Materials
      items:
        - The theory of novel two-dimensional materials beyond graphene. The kinematic constraints in 2D lead to interesting phenomena, such as a different dacy rate for "odd-parity" deformations of the Fermi surface.
